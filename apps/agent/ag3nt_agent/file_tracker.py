"""File staleness detection for AG3NT.

Tracks file read/write timestamps per session to prevent editing stale files.
If a file has been modified on disk since the agent last read it, edits are
blocked with a helpful error message telling the agent to re-read the file.

Usage:
    from ag3nt_agent.file_tracker import FileTracker

    tracker = FileTracker.get_instance()
    tracker.record_read("session-1", "/path/to/file.py")
    # ... later ...
    tracker.assert_fresh("session-1", "/path/to/file.py")  # raises if file changed on disk
    tracker.record_write("session-1", "/path/to/file.py")
